🔴 1. Over-Reliance on Publicly Available Tools
Weakness: Playwright, axe-core, and pa11y are well-known. Using them does not make the invention novel.

Fix:

Emphasize your unique orchestration mechanism.

Explicitly document how these tools are integrated with:

LLM-driven reasoning

Dynamic prompt chaining

Real-time test adaptation based on DOM feedback

Create a clear architecture diagram showing your logic layer as the core innovation.

🟠 2. Lack of Detailed Novelty in LLM Application
Weakness: “Using LLMs for WCAG interpretation” is general and may not stand out.

Fix:

Describe how your LLM:

Parses JSON from axe-core and maps it to WCAG.

Generates contextual code suggestions based on real DOM state.

Adapts prompt behavior based on prior feedback (via memory or scoring).

Consider:

“A modular prompt pipeline for LLM-guided accessibility remediation using structured violation output and RAG-enhanced WCAG embeddings.”

🟡 3. Missing Specific Workflow Logic or Pseudocode
Weakness: The proposal lacks technical depth in the orchestration logic.

Fix:

Add pseudocode or flowcharts for:

Prompt chaining logic.

How Playwright execution affects subsequent LLM actions.

How remediation suggestions are scored and prioritized.

Use this to show novelty in decision flow, not just the components.

🟡 4. Not Differentiating from Competing Systems
Weakness: Doesn’t explicitly show how your system improves over tools like Deque WorldSpace, Microsoft Accessibility Insights, etc.

Fix:

Include a competitive landscape table.

Highlight where your system uniquely:

Combines dynamic DOM querying + LLM reasoning.

Integrates RAG + fine-tuning for evolving WCAG.

Automates remediation prioritization using severity + traffic-weighted scoring.

🔴 5. Incomplete RAG Strategy for Regulatory Compliance
Weakness: RAG is mentioned, but the structure of the vector DB and update mechanisms are not fully developed.

Fix:

Define:

How you construct the vector index (by WCAG section? JSON violation tags?).

How often it updates, and what triggers a re-index.

What source documents feed it (W3C docs, court rulings, best practice guides?).

Add a “WCAG Knowledge Engine” section describing this.

🟠 6. Weak Remediation Verification Path
Weakness: You generate suggestions, but how are they verified before pushing to production?

Fix:

Define a review-assist workflow:

LLM proposes fix → HTML snapshot taken → Playwright re-tests post-fix → summary report shown to human for override.

Optional: introduce a “suggestion confidence score” from LLM based on token certainty or matching to known patterns.

🟢 7. Not Leveraging Feedback Loops Fully
Opportunity: You mention feedback loops, but don’t show them clearly in architecture.

Fix:

Add a feedback loop diagram that shows:

User review signals → used to fine-tune prompts or flag hallucinations.

Issue recurrence → causes rule refinement in test generation.

Consider labeling it the “Human-AI Reinforcement Loop.”

Optional Enhancements for IP Strength:
LLM prompt optimizer that minimizes hallucination in remediation using real-time audit history.

Accessibility issue heatmap across page flows based on live user focus/emphasis.

Use of AI explainability layer: LLM justifies why a violation matters to a screen reader user.
